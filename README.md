## Data Quality Tools

### Artist Recordings

A simple UI to list the recordings ascribed to an artist and quickly spot problems:
 - no dates assigned
 - hanging recordings
 - wrong credits (e.g., an orchestra credited as conductor)
 - etc.

### Release series

A simple UI to list the releases in a series grouped by number in order to spot
missing/wrong data, for example, missing album covers, wrong recording credits, bad
title style, etc.
